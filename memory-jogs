Misc reminders to jog my memory.

#§
#https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#locale.getpreferredencoding.
#Returns encoding used by python for text data.
#The way in which getpreferredencoding() fetches language preference is os dependent.

import locale
locale.getpreferredencoding()

#§
#Open jupyter server with directory listing in cwd.
jupyter notebook .

#§
[1].remove(1) #removes first element of value arg
[1].pop(0) #removes element at index of arg and returns it
del mylist[0] #like pop, but does not return (and it has different error type)

virtualbox nat port forwarding (i.e. nginx)
Open virtual machine’s settings window. Select network pane. Ensure NAT is checked. Expand Advanced section and click Port Forwarding.
Host and/or guest IP are optional (leave blank). 
The host port is the port from which you want to access the web server from the outside i.e. 2215.
The guest port is the port on which your web server is actually running within the vm i.e. 80.
Now from the host you can access via localhost:2215.

The uwsgi-docs for nginx is well written and has some excellent pointers 
  (i.e. for dynamic uwsgi routing, some situations call for tcp instead of unix sock, or allow nginx to serve static files directly)  
  https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Nginx.html
uwsgi_params is included with nginx by default.
Only special need for uwsgi config in nginx is to `include uwsgi_params;` and `uwsgi_pass unix:/path_to_unix_sock` within our `server { loc {` block.
